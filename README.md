# ColorTool

This is a powerful, yet beautiful and easy-to-use color management tool.

It already supports:

-   A color circle to adjust hue and saturation
-   Sliders to adjust hue, saturation, luminance, red, green, blue and alpha
-   A nice color palette to choose from
-   An input for the hexadecimal representation (`#RRGGBB`, `#RRGGBBAA`)
